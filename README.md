Advent of code challenges

# Code Notice
My goal for advent of code is to complete the challenges for *fun*. Thus, code
in this repository is at worst inefficient, or nonsensical.

If I was tasked with writing production standard code it would almost certainly
not look like what's here!

As a father just finding time to solve these challenges is difficult enough!
